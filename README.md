# Secure Enterprise Network Setup with Virtualisation & Monitoring

## 🛡️ Project Overview
This project involved designing and implementing a **secure enterprise network infrastructure** with VLAN-based segmentation, virtualization, and continuous monitoring. The setup ensured high availability, layered security, and centralized administration using open-source tools.

## 🔧 Key Features
- ✅ VLAN-based Network Segmentation
- 🖥️ Windows Server & Ubuntu Server Installations
- 💾 RAID Configuration for Redundancy
- 🐳 Containerization with Docker
- 🤖 Infrastructure Automation using Ansible
- 🔒 Network Hardening using pfSense Firewall & Snort IDS
- 📡 Real-time Monitoring via Nagios and Wireshark

## 🔨 Tools & Technologies
- **VirtualBox**
- **Ubuntu Server**, **Windows Server**
- **pfSense**, **Snort**
- **Docker**
- **Ansible**
- **Nagios**, **Wireshark**
- **VLAN**, **RAID**, **SSH**, **Firewall Rules**

## 📁 Components Implemented
| Component               | Description                                           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Servers**            | Installed Ubuntu & Windows Server in VirtualBox       |
| **Storage**            | Configured RAID 0/1 for data redundancy               |
| **Network Security**   | Used pfSense for firewall & Snort for intrusion detection |
| **Containerization**   | Deployed services using Docker                        |
| **Automation**         | Automated server tasks using Ansible                 |
| **Monitoring**         | Monitored traffic using Nagios and Wireshark         |

## 📌 Outcome
Successfully built a secure and automated network lab that simulates an enterprise environment, improving hands-on knowledge of server management, cybersecurity, automation, and monitoring.
